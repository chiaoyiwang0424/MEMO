	  <p>The MEMO dataset is established for the development and evaluation of multimodal retinal image registration with both large vessel segmentation ground truth and registration ground turth.</p>
	  <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
	  <p>The MEMO dataset contains 30 pairs of EMA and OCTA images. For each image pair, 6 corresponding point pairs were manually annotated. In addition, each image comes with a carefully annotated large vessel segmentation mask.</p>
	  <p>The following raw images are included for each image pair:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>An EMA stacked image (Folder path: /MEMO/Original EMA stack)</li>
		<li>A folder for EMA sequence images (Under preparation)</li>
		<li>A folder for three OCTA projection images, including SVP, ICP and DCP layer projection images (Folder path: /MEMO/Original OCTA)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>For our own experiments, we scaled all OCTA SVP images to 256 * 256 and the EMA stacked images were scaled based on same sclaing factor. Therefore, we also provide the following scaled images:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Scaled EMA stacked image (Folder path: /MEMO/Scaled EMA stack)</li>
		<li>Scaled OCTA SVP image (Folder path: /MEMO/Scaled OCTA SVP)</li>
		<li>A large vessel segmentation mask of EMA image (Folder path: /MEMO/Scaled EMA stack lv seg ground truth)</li>
		<li>A large vessel segmentation mask of OCTA image (Folder path: /MEMO/Scaled OCTA SVP lv seg ground truth)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> Six corresponding point pairs of every EMA and OCTA pair are provided in <em>RegistrationGT.csv</em>. In this file, the pixel coordinate (x and y) of corresponding point pairs are listed. For example, the pixel coordinate (OCTA_x1, OCTA_y1) on OCTA image is matched to the pixel coordinate (EMA_x1, EMA_y1) on EMA stacked image. All the pixel coordinate are based on the scaled images.</p>.
